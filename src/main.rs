//! Ozo is a very basic CLI for the headless Oxidation torrent client.
//!
//! Ozo can operate in two modes, the first of which is the
//! primary focus of Ozo's current development:
//! * Immediate
//!	* Active
//!
//! # Immediate
//!
//! Immediate mode is the most bare-bones CLI interface. It's
//! completely stateless, and nothing is continally active.
//! Every query is a new connection to the Oxidation server,
//! with no practical state conserved from run to run, apart
//! from minimal caching.
//!
//! # Active
//!
//! Active mode is planned to be a TUI written with ncurses,
//! which maintains an active connection to the Oxidation server
//! in order to continually update its state.
